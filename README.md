1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll:

getElementById selects one element with a specific id.

getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a class and gives an HTMLCollection.

querySelector selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.

querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a CSS selector and gives a NodeList.

2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM:

Use document.createElement("tag") to create an element.

Add content with innerText or innerHTML.

Insert it using appendChild, prepend, before, or after.

3. What is Event Bubbling and how it works:

Event Bubbling is when an event happens on a child element and then moves up to its parents.

Example: If you click a button inside a div, the click happens on the button first, then the div, then body, and so on.

4. What is Event Delegation and why it is useful:

Event Delegation is adding an event listener to a parent and handling events for its children.

It is useful because you donâ€™t need to add listeners to every child, and it works for dynamically added elements.

5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation():

preventDefault() stops the default action of the browser, like preventing a link from opening.

stopPropagation() stops the event from moving up (bubbling) or down (capturing) in the DOM.
